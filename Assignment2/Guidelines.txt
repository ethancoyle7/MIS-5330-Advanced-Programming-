### Module 2 Exercise: Vectors, ###
###  Matrices and Data Frames   ###
###################################

# Please deposit your solutions in the dropbox
# for module 3 by Saturday, September 12th 11:59 PM
# Central Time. Late exercises will automatically
# be reduced in grade by 10 points (10 percent).
# However, late exercises WILL be accepted up
# to 1 week after the exercise due date/time
# (That is, until September 19th 11:59 PM). After
# that (Sept 19 11:59 PM) no assignments will be
# accepted and you will earn a 0 for that exercise.

# In the R script solution file that you deposit
# in the dropbox, put the name of the course,
# your name and Exercise 2; for example:
# MIS5330_Geoff_Hubona_Exercise_2.R

# Please write all your answers in an R script
# file and submit the .R file as per above.
# Use comments (##) to indicate your written
# answers.

# Each answer to the 20 questions counts five
# points towards your overall exercise #2 grade.
# Some of the questions are more difficult
# than others so do not put this assignment
# off until the last moment.

# NOTE: ALL WORK IS TO BE YOUR OWN WORK

#1) Consider a vector:
vec1 <- c(4,6,5,7,10,9,4,15)
# What is the value of:
vec1 < 7
# Why?

# Write out your answer here after
# comment symbols (#) heading each line.

# By indexing, create a new vector "vec1a"
# that only contains the elements of vec1
# that are less than 7
# < Your R code goes here >

#2) Consider two vectors:
p <- c(3, 5, 6, 8)
# and
q <- c(6, 2, 4)
# What is the value of:
p+q
# Why? Be explicit in your answer.
# NOTE: There is output, in spite 
# of the warning message

#3) Consider the two vectors:
p <- c(3, 5)
# and
q <- c(6, 2, 4, 3)
# What is the value of:
p*q
# Why? Be explicit in your answer.
# Write out your answer here after
# comment symbols (#) heading each line.

#4) Consider this R code to create
#   a data frame:
Age <- c(22, 25, 18, 20)
Name <- c("James", "Mathew", "Olivia", "Stella")
Gender <- c("M", "M", "F", "F")
df4 <- data.frame(Age, Name, Gender)
df4
#   Age   Name Gender
# 1  22  James      M
# 2  25 Mathew      M
# 3  18 Olivia      F
# 4  20 Stella      F

# Write one line of R code that produces
# this output (without the comment marks):

##   Age   Name Gender
## 1  22  James      M
## 2  25 Mathew      M

# < Your R code goes here >

#5) If
z <- 0:9
z
# Then what is the output from these statements?
digits <- as.character(z)
digits
# Why (from the preceding statement only)?
# Write out your answer here after
# comment symbols (#) heading each line. 

as.integer(digits)
# Why (from the preceding statement only)?
# Write out your answer here after
# comment symbols (#) heading each line. 

#6) Consider the vector:
x <- c(1,2,3,4)
# What is the value of k for:
(x+2)[(!is.na(x)) & x > 0] -> k
# Why (from the preceding statement only)?
# Write out your answer here after
# comment symbols (#) heading each line. 

#7) If
x <- c(2, 4, 6, 8)
# and
y <- c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)
# Then what is the value of this expression?
sum(x[y])
# Why? Be explicit in your answer.
# Write out your answer here after
# comment symbols (#) heading each line. 

#8) Consider the vector:
x <- c(34, 56, 55, 87, NA, 4, 77, NA, 21, NA, 39)
x
# Write a single line of R code
# that will output the number of NA's in the vector.

# < Your R code goes here >

#9) If 
X <- c(NA, 3, 14, NA, 33, 17, NA, 41)
x
# Write one line of R code that will remove all
# occurrences of NA in X.

# < Your R code goes here >

#10) If 
Y <- c(1, 3, 12, NA, 33, 7, NA, 21)
Y
# Write one line of R code that will replace
# all occurrences of NA in Y with 11.

# < Your R code goes here >

#11) Consider two matrices: M,N where
M <- matrix(c(1:9),3,3,byrow=T)
M
N <- matrix(c(1:9),3,3)
N
# What is the value of:
M*N
# Why? Be explicit.
# What is the value of:
N/M # NOTE: matrix N is numerator
# Why? Be explicit (from the preceding statement only)?
# Write out your answer here after
# comment symbols (#) heading each line. 

#12) Create the following data frame. NOTE: 
#    the people names are NOT the first 
#    column, they are the rownames. You
#    might want to call up help for data.frame()

#          Age  Height  Weight   Sex
# Alex      17      65     170     M
# Lilly     25      60     135     F
# Mark      29      72     185     M
# Oliver    18      66     175     M
# Martha    31      64     145     F
# Ken       42      73     195     M
# Mary      22      60     125     F

# < Your R code goes here >

# Then write some R code that will change
# all the Sex M's to F's and all the
# Sex F's to M's.

# < Your R code goes here >

#13) What class of data is the (built-in data set) 
state.center
# Convert it to data frame.

# < Your R code goes here >

#14) Consider the following data frame
#    constructed from 3 vectors
age <- c(35, 22, 33, 45, 17, 21, 26)
name <- c("Jeff", "John", "Jim", "Lou",
          "Mary", "Ellen", "Ted")
weight <- c(225, 180, 205, 210, 165, 145, 195)

people <- data.frame(age, name, weight)
people

# What is the value of 
is.factor(people$name)
# Why? name is a character vector. Be explicit.
# Then write R code to order the entire
# data frame by age.

# < Your R code goes here >

#15) Consider the following factor vector:
fac.x <- factor(LETTERS[1:5])
fac.x
# Try to add the letter "F" as the sixth
# element of fac.x:
fac.x[6] <- c("F")
fac.x
# What happened? Why?
# Write some R code so that you can
# add "F" as the sixth element WITHOUT
# recreating the factor vector from 
# the beginning.

# < Your R code goes here >

#16) Create a 4 (rows) x 5 (columns) matrix 
#    named mat16 consisting of the sequence 
#    of numbers from 21 to 40. Make sure that
#    the numbers populate the matrix by rows, 
#    and not by columns.

# < Your R code goes here >

# Change the row names to row1, row2, row3 and
# row4. Then change the column names to col1,
# col2, col3, col4 and col5.

# < Your R code goes here >

#17) Change mat16 to a data frame named "df17"

# < Your R code goes here >

# Create two more vectors:
col6 <- c(41:44)
col7 <- c(45:48)

# Join vectors col6 and col7 to data
# frame df17 that they comprise 
# columns 6 and 7 of df17

# < Your R code goes here >

#18) Take df17 and convert it to
#    a list with the name "list18".

# < Your R code goes here >

# Then add list18 as the eighth
# component of list18

# < Your R code goes here >

#19) Consider the following matrix:
mat19 <- matrix(1:18, nrow = 3)
mat19
# Write a short R command that
# outputs the following (without
# the comment marks:

#      [,1] [,2] [,3]
# [1,]    1    2    3
# [2,]    4    5    6
# [3,]    7    8    9
# [4,]   10   11   12
# [5,]   13   14   15
# [6,]   16   17   18

# < Your R code goes here >

#20) Create the following data frame:
name <- c("Harry", "Ron", "John", "Jerry", "Betty")
weight <- c(176, 175, 167, 230, 180)
gpa <- c(3.4, 2.8, 4.0, 2.2, 3.4)
df20 <- data.frame(name, weight, gpa)
df20

# Write a brief line of R code that
# Reassigns John's weight to be 195

# < Your R code goes here >

# Filter out the students in df20 who
# have a GPA higher than 3.0 and put
# them in a new data frame named "df20a"

# < Your R code goes here >
